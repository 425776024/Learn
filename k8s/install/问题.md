1. The connection to the server 192.168.1.24:6443 was refused - did you specify the right host or port?
关闭防火墙： swapoff -a

2. coredns  CrashLoopBackOff 报错
```
Here are the things I've done so far:

Adding nameserver 192.168.1.3 to /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base file. (192.168.1.3 is our network's DNS).
Running: sudo resolvconf --enable-updates.
Running: sudo resolvconf -u.
Running: sudo service network-manager restart (just to make sure).
Yet when I open the /etc/resolv.conf file it says: nameserver 127.0.1.1! Does anyone have any idea what's wrong?

Please note that it's actually 127.0.1.1! And I have no idea why it's not 127.0.0.1!

Even when I update the /etc/resolv.conf manually and change it to anything else, the sudo resolvconf -u will revert it back to 127.0.1.1! Where is this address coming from?

NetworkManager is the program which (via the resolvconf utility) inserts address 127.0.1.1 into resolv.conf.
 NM inserts that address if an only if it is configured to start an instance of the dnsmasq program to serve as a local forwarding nameserver. 
 That dnsmasq instance listens for queries at address 127.0.1.1.
If you do not want to use a local forwarding nameserver then configure NetworkManager not to start a dnsmasq instance and not to insert that address. 
In /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf comment out the line dns=dnsmasq
sudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf
[main]
plugins=ifupdown,keyfile,ofono
#dns=dnsmasq
and restart the NetworkManager service.

sudo service network-manager restart
```

3. k8s V1.11.1报错：The connection to the server localhost:8080 was refused
```
mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

或者以root用户运行，导入环境变量：
export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf
```

4. Pod Network 安装失败
```
root 执行
export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf
sysctl net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=1

kubectl apply -f kube-flannel.yml

sudo ln -sf /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf

kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/flannel/master/Documentation/k8s-manifests/kube-flannel-rbac.yml
kubectl create -f https://github.com/coreos/flannel/blob/master/Documentation/k8s-manifests/kube-flannel-rbac.yml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/flannel/master/Documentation/kube-flannel.yml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/flannel/master/Documentation/k8s-manifests/kube-flannel-legacy.yml
